# PyCrystGA_Public
PyCrystGA is a Genetic Algorithm Written in Python 3 for Structure Solution of Molecular Crystal Structures from PXRD.

PyCrystGA has been developed to prioritise minimal user input, and has been coded in a modular way to facilitate ease of development and implementation of additional functionality, either by the creator or users of the code. It makes use of automated data visualisation via matplotlib, and stores all run-related information automatically in an SQL relational database. 

TOPAS-Academic - a software developed by Alan Coelho links to whick can be found here: http://www.topas-academic.net/ - has been integrated into PyCrystGA and is used to carry out the crystallographically relevant features of the algorithm such as: crystal structure simulation, PXRD pattern simulation, and fitness evaluation (additional applications such as GSAS-II should be made available in the future).

If you would like to make use of any of the code in this repository you are free to do so!
